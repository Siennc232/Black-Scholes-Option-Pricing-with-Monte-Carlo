## ðŸ“ŠOptions Pricing: Where Math Meets Money
Welcome to my options pricing playground! This repository contains my personal project where I attempt to make sense of financial derivatives without losing my sanity.

### What's Inside

- Black-Scholes vs. Monte Carlo: Watch as two pricing models duke it out in the algorithmic octagon
- Real Market Analysis: AAPL and SPY options data revealing that theoretical models and reality have a complicated relationship
- Volatility Smiles: Because even options pricing curves have a sense of humor
- Beautiful Visualizations: Proving that finance can actually look pretty

### Key Findings
- My analysis shows that Monte Carlo simulations slightly outperform Black-Scholes models in real-world accuracy, but both struggle with deep in-the-money and out-of-the-money options.
- Also, I've confirmed that the closer we get to expiration, the more chaotic everything becomes â€“ much like college deadlines.

### Technologies Used
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and enough caffeine to power a small village.
